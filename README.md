# Guidance :  

```Bash
- Launch Postman: Open the Postman application on your computer.

- Create a New Request: Click on the "New" button in Postman to create a new request.

- Set Request Type: Choose the HTTP method for your request (e.g., POST).

- Enter Request URL: Enter the URL of your Flask API endpoint. If you're running your Flask app locally, the URL might be something like http://localhost:5000/send_verification_code.

- Set Request Headers: If your Flask API expects specific headers (e.g., Content-Type), add them to the request.

- Set Request Body: In the request body section, select "form-data" if you're sending data as form parameters. Then, add a key-value pair with the key "number" and the phone number as the value (e.g., +923081939075).

- Send the Request: Click on the "Send" button to send the request to your Flask API.

- Review Response: After sending the request, you should see the response from your Flask API in the "Response" section of Postman. Check if the response indicates that the verification code was sent successfully or if there are any errors.
